<p><strong>Read</strong> Matthew 2:1-6</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem, saying, “Where is he who has been born king of the Jews? For we saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him.” When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him; and assembling all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born. They told him, “In Bethlehem of Judea, for so it is written by the prophet:</p><p>“‘And you, O Bethlehem, in the land of Judah,<br>     are by no means least among the rulers of Judah;<br> for from you shall come a ruler<br>     who will shepherd my people Israel.’”</p></blockquote><p><strong>Meditate</strong></p><p>I love good news. I love wedding and baby announcements, birthday wishes, job promotions.</p><p>Many times, though, someone&#8217;s good news is someone else’s not-so-good news. Your new job (good news) means someone else did not get the job (bad news), for instance. Good news, bad news.</p><p>So, while we focus on the good news in the story of Christmas, there were some people who did not see it that way.</p><p>Herod, for instance.</p><p>It is easy to understand. After all, you are the king. Then some guys show up and ask about finding the new king. It is kind of like walking in to work one morning, and your boss walks up to you and says, “Meet Susan. She is going to replace you. Train her well. Thanks.”</p><p>Awkward.</p><p>The coming of the Christ-child is good news for many, but not all. His coming means that there is a new king, and not everyone wants to find out they are no longer king of their life.</p><p>The good news of Jesus as king means my days of being king of my life are numbered. And, I have two choices: accept him as king, or try to kill him. I can deny my need for a new king, try to discredit him, attempt to remove him from the throne or ignore him.</p><p>But he is still the new king. And he makes the rules.</p><p>That is why we sometimes struggle with accepting Jesus as our king. We don’t want to give up the throne. We want him as Savior, but the good news of a new king is not good news. It means the total surrender of my life to a new ruler.</p><p>But the old king is dead. Long live the King!</p><p><strong>Pray</strong></p><p>“Father, thank you for the new king. Help me to willingly step down from the throne of my life and worship the new king. Amen.”</p><p><strong>Contemplate</strong></p><p>Take some quiet time today to reflect on your life. Are there areas where you are still trying to be king, or have you surrendered everything to Christ? Some areas to examine are your calling, your finances, and your time. Is Christ King of your singleness? Is he king of your marriage?</p><p>The Holy Bible, English Standard Version. ESV® Text Edition: 2016.
